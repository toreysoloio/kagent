/**
 * Every call the UI knows how to make, behind a stable id.
 *
 * This replaces the path table this file's predecessor held. The controller no
 * longer serves the application API over REST — it is gRPC, wrapped as gRPC-Web
 * (`grpcserver.WebHandler`, routed in `go/core/internal/httpserver/server.go`) —
 * so there is no longer a path to name. What is left to name is the *operation*:
 * "list model configs", "create a model config". An id per operation is what the
 * rest of the app depends on, and it is what survived.
 *
 * Nothing above this file addresses a service or a method. Going through ids
 * means a deployment can replace one operation's implementation (see
 * `registerOperationOverride` in `extensionPoints`) without any caller changing,
 * and the mock backend can register fakes from the same table the real client
 * builds calls from.
 *
 * ## One id per operation, never shared
 *
 * Kept from the path table, and for the same reason: the id — not the RPC — is
 * what an override is keyed by, so sharing one between a list read and a create
 * would mean an extension re-pointing a list silently re-pointed creation with it,
 * with no way to override one alone. Two ids resolving to the
 * same RPC is the cost of keeping those two things separately addressable.
 *
 * ## Where the RPCs are
 *
 * The default implementation of each id lives in `./grpc/operations.ts`, next to
 * the conversion between the proto messages and this app's domain types. The
 * mapping from id to RPC is documented there, including the four places where it
 * is not one-to-one.
